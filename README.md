# Truly Custom Horse Tack


This mod adds horse armor for the mod [Realistic Horse Genetics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/realistic-horse-genetics "Realistic Horse Genetics") that are truly customizable. Simply craft a saddler block and make armor just as you would customize a banner!

## Features

**Saddler Block**: A new block that behaves just like a loom but for horse armor! Includes a nice horse display so you can preview your changes.

**Customization Options**: Personalize your horse's armor with different colors, and patterns! Included are various tack patterns to organize the various options from winter, cute, and racing!

**Correct Leather Armor**: Just as the mod [Dyed](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dyed "Dyed"), leather armor now correctly has an overlay.

**Horse Jumps**: Blocks that act like a stone wall that make customizable horse jump sizes! Comes in all concrete colors.

**Horse Potions**: For creative use only, allows you to alter your horses stats.

## FAQ

### Is this mod compatible with other mods?

This mod must be used with Realistic Horse Genetics. Any mod that adds horse armor, may not have armor textures made for RHG. However outside of that there shouldn't be any conflicts that I'm aware of.

### My custom tack doesn't display anything! / Doesn't display a saddle!

By default custom tack is completely empty, including no saddle or bridle. If you want a saddle and bridle with your custom tack select those options in the saddler table!

### Can I submit patterns?

Absolutely! You can either raise an issue/PR request on Github or DM me on CurseForge. Every pattern option requires 3 parts: a 14x14 icon for the table, texture on horse that gets colored, texture on horse that does not get colored (optional if empty).

### Can I use this in modpacks / videos?

Sure! If this mod brings a smile to at least one person, I've achieved my goal.

### Something isn't accurately representing the real world thing it should!

Please raise a Github issue or DM me! I've never been around horses in my life, and I'm sure I made a mistake -- I would love to fix it :)
